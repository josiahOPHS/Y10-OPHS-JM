#Varaibles Vs Constants
#Variables are declared in titlecase
#CONSTANTS are declared in CAPITALS 

#Example of varaible

Team1Name = "Man City"
Team2Name = "Arsenal"

#Varaibles have a useful name
#Variables store a value (can change)
#Varaibles can not start with a number
#e.g. Team1Name = "Man City"
#This will cause a syntax error

#Varaibles cannot have a space in the name
#e.g. Team Name = "Man City"
#This will be a syntax error

#This is an example of a CONSTANT 
FREETHROW = 1
TWOPOINTER = 2
THREEPOINTER = 3

#The value is a CONSTANT do not change
